NAME
	pcf2bdf  - convert X font from Portable Compiled Format to
	Bitmap Distribution Format

SYNOPSIS
	pcf2bdf [ -v ] [ -o outputfile ] [ fontfile.pcf[.gz] ]

DESCRIPTION
	Pcf2bdf is a font de-compiler.  It converts  X  font  from
	Portable Compiled Format (PCF) to Bitmap Distribution For-
	mat (BDF).  It can also accept  a  compressed/gzipped  PCF
	file as input, but gzip must be found in your PATH.

	FONTBOUNDINGBOX in a BDF file is not used by bdftopcf , so
	pcf2bdf generate irresponsible values.

OPTIONS
	-v      very verbose output.

	-o output-file-name
		 By default pcf2bdf writes the bdf file to standard
		 output; this option gives the name of a file to be
		 used instead.
